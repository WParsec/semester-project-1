                <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to life through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. </p>
                <p>Interact and play around with exhibitions to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

                 <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>

                <h3>Volenteer</h3>
                <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                    You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.
